# Libft Test  
Test your libft functions made at 42 with this piece of code. Clone it into your libft folder in a subfolder; and execute "make test". This test was made by myself and thanks to the help of other tests like the moulitest or unittest.

### Here is the help!  
This programm helps you to test your libft project made at 42 - or anyone willing to recode on his/her own the lib c. It's just another test among other available on Github, and it was at first made to help me understand how to debug a code.  
If you are learning, I advise you better debugg your functions yourself. Or you can still help me to improve this debugging programm, that is quite simple to understand for newbies ;)  

### How to use me?!  
Just enter those few arguments while executing the code:  
* **part1** = test only part 1 of libft;  
* **part2** = test only part 2 of libft;  
* **bonus** = test only bonus of libft;  
* **all** = test the whole libft, bonus included;  
* **-debug** = enter the debugging mode (still beta);  
 * *'xxx*' : where xxx is the name of the function to debugg. There can be one or more functions separated by space.  
If you enter no argument, everything will be debbug.  
 * *'exit'* ; tape exit to go back to normal mode.  
* **help** = show this help file
